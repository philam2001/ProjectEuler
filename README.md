# Project Euler

These are my solutions to the Project Euler mathematical problems. I was introduced to this by an Amazon Recruiter when I asked for advice on what I can do to be successful in technical interviews as I'm not from a CS background, and this is something he recommended! I am to solve one at least every week and aim to have my solutions in Golang, Python, and Java.
